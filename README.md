# Overview
The `FhirToPandas` class is designed to handle the conversion of FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) files to pandas DataFrames. This allows for the extraction and processing of various FHIR data elements into structured CSV files for easier analysis and manipulation.

The `CCDAToPandas` class facilitates the conversion of CCDA (Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture) XML files into pandas DataFrames. It provides methods to parse XML content, extract relevant data such as medication details, observation results, and problem data, and then save this processed information as CSV files for further analysis.
